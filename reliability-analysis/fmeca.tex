\hline
	Functional Block & Failure Mode & Failure Cause & Effects & Criticality & Suggested Action \\ \hline
	Power Regulation & 5V rail voltage $>$5V & 5V regulator internal short & Destruction of 3.3V regulator and all microelectronics, including \gls{pi} & Critical & Choose a reliable 5V regulator, include over-voltage protection circuit. \\ \hline
	Power Regulation & 5V rail voltage $<$5V & 5V regulator internal open circuit & No microcontroller on system starts & Marginal & include instructions on replacing the 5V regulator \\ \hline
	Power Regulation & 3.3V rail voltage $>$3.3V & 3.3V regulator internal short & Destruction of all microelectronics on control board & Marginal & Choose a reliable 3.3V regulator, include over-voltage protection circuit \\ \hline
	Power Regulation & 3.3V rail voltage $<$3.3V & 3.3V regulator internal open circuit & Control board microcontroller does not start, \gls{pi} cannot connect to microcontroller & Marginal & Choose a reliable 3.3V regulator, include instructions on replacing the 3.3V regulator \\ \hline
	Off-Board Connectors & Poor electrical connection & Worn out connectors & Poor inter-system communication & Marginal & Design system so that disconnecting and reconnecting of connectors is not frequently required, include instructions on replacing the connectors \\ \hline
	$\mu$Controller & Incorrect control pulses & Bug in code & \gls{cnc} accuracy less than expected & Negligible & Make firmware upgrades possible in-system through bootloader \\ \hline
	Csrystal & No oscillation & Electrical or mechanical shock to crystal & Control board microcontroller does not start & Marginal & Include handling and electrical shock prevention instructions \\ \hline
