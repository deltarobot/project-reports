\chapter{Project Definition}
\section{Definition Revisions}
The definition has been reviewed and the scope was deemed too large.
It was then decided that the project would be redefined as a CNC Interface.

The CNC Interface will be the interface to interpret G-code and to the motor driver board.
The revised product will be configurable to operate on different mechanical systems. 
The current system for converting G-code for use on a CNC currently requires a whole computer. 
With this system, a web interface will be utilized to upload the G-code files.
A master controller will be used to interpret this G-code to motor commands. 
These commands will be sent to the motor driver board that will drive the motors.
Making this interface automated will improve the ability for students and hobbyists to have their own CNC Interface for 3D printing or PCB milling.

\subsection{Revised Objective Tree}

\label{fig:Objective Tree}
\end{figure}

The objective tree has been revised to reflect objectives that are verifiable.
Thermal Monitoring was weighted as most important because it is a safety feature.
The Motor Driver is a second priority because it is the main functionality.
The Motor Control and G-Code Interpreter were decided to be equally important by using Piecewise Comparisons.
Motor Control relates to the motor accuracy.
G-Code Interpretation is the software interface that will allow a file to be uploaded and sent through TCP/IP.
The Power Supply range is least important because the unit can ship with a standard, tested power supply. 
\subsection{Revised Statement of Project Scope}
The Project Scope has been refocused. 
The mechanical requirements and the human-machine interfacing for the project have been eliminated.
The scope now only includes the software for the G-code interpretation, its upload interface, the master controller, the motor controller and the motor driver board.
The G-code interpretation software will have a G-code file as an input and then output motor driver commands from the master controller to the motor controller.
The motor controller will then send out the driver signals to the motor driver board. 
The motor driver board will take the command outputs from the motor controller and then drive the motors. 
There will also be 16 \gls{gpio} pins, an emergency stop switch, and home switches for the motors. 
With this redefined scope, a more polished end product will be achieved. 
\section{Microprocessor Functionality}
The main microprocessor, an \gls{arm} 11 on the \gls{pi}, will primarily be responsible for controlling the three stepper motors for the delta robot.
This objective will be achieved by creating a G-code interpreter written in C.
G-code is a standard way to instruct a \gls{cnc} router to move the work head, but is more complicated than accepting individual commands to move the motors.
The microprocessor will be responsible for scheduling movements to make smooth transitions to the destination, as interpreted from the G-code.

The system will be a network device, connected through WiFi or Ethernet.
The microprocessor will obtain G-code commands through local storage or by accepting G-code files over TCP/IP.
The G-code received over TCP/IP and will be stored locally for faster use again in the future.
Execution of G-code sequences will be started through a TCP/IP interface.
All network interfaces will be password protected and use encryption algorithms to ensure that all commands executed are from authorized users. 

A secondary microprocessor may be required to precisely control stepper motors and the \gls{gpio}.
This secondary microprocessor will perform any required communication with the network-connected main microprocessor through a serial interface. 

\section{CEEN Appropriateness}
The design and execution of the CNC Interface will meet at least 7 of the 11 ABET accreditation criteria.
The design and construction will require the rigorous application of mathematics, science, and engineering for the software, hardware, mechanical, and system control. (ABET 3a).
Notably, the kinematics of the robot will require intense mathematical computations to ensure accuracy.
Experiments must be designed and conducted to ensure proper operation of components and the final result (ABET 3b).
The end result of the project will meet the needs outlined in the Background Summary (ABET 3c).
The level of success of the project will depend on how well the the team is able to cooperate and strive to achieve common goals (ABET 3d).
This project will present many engineering problems that will have to be solved (ABET 3e).
Not only must the group work towards common goals, but they must also communicate effectively (ABET 3g).
Similarly to ABET 3a, the entire project will involve the use of engineering skills that have been learned in previous coursework (ABET 3k).

The senior capstone project also serves as a culmination of the CEEN curriculum. Concepts and skills learned in previous courses must be applied in the design, construction, and documentation of the project.
Courses that will be built upon in the design of the CNC Inteface are:
\begin{enumerate} \parskip2pt
	\item Microprocessor Applications
	\item Electrical \& Electronic Circuits
	\item Communication Systems
	\item Signals \& Linear Systems
	\item Digital Design \& Interface
