\chapter{Testing and Integration}
Validation and verification prove to all stakeholders that the goals of the project have been met.
Thorough testing throughout the entire project is vital to identifying potential issues and correcting them before a final product is created. 
Validation was completed by comparing the engineering requirements with the marketing requirements that were discussed by the team. 

The following 10 items are the success criteria for the project. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a complete \gls{bom} and order/sample all parts needed for the design.
	\item Develop complete, accurate, readable schematic of the design, complete with interface loading analysis and interface timing analysis. 
	\item Complete a layout and etch a \gls{pcb}.
	\item Populate and debug the design on a custom \gls{pcb}.
	\item Professionally package the finished product and demonstrate its functionality.
	\item Stepper motor frequency capable of at least 10kHz, accurate within $\pm5\%$ of desired frequency.
	\item Receive G-code through \gls{tcpip}. Software will be developed using IEEE Std 830-1998 Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
	\item Accept between 14V and 36V and draw no more than 10A.
	\item Drive at least 4 stepper motors, 1 DC motor, and 16 GPIO. Receive input from at least 1 motor limit/emergency stop switch and 4 stepper motor home inputs.
	\item Thermal shutdown will occur above CPU temperatures of $60^{\circ}C$.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Validation Metrics}
Table ~\ref{table:Val} shows the relationship between the engineering requirements and the marketing requirements.
For a marketing requirement to be validated, the respective engineering requirements must be verified.

\section{Verification Metrics}
The following tests will give proof that all of the ten engineering requirements have been met.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Print out the schematic and the \gls{bom}. Work through all components on the schematic, placing a check mark next to each component and the corresponding part on the \gls{bom}. Once the schematic has been fully reviewed, ensure that all items on the \gls{bom} have exactly one check mark next to them.
	\item Use schematic as the netlist for the \gls{pcb} and do not make any manual modifications to the netlist. Print out the schematic and review it with Professor Detloff to ensure readability. Verify loading and interface timing analyses through experimental measures using an oscilloscope. 
	\item Generate a \gls{pcb} layout that passes all \gls{drc} operations performed by the \gls{drc} check available at http://www.4pcb.com. 
	\item Use a \gls{dmm} to verify connectivity on all solder joints.
	\item Demonstrate a fully-functional project at the annual senior design showcase.
